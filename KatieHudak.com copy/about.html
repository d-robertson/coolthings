               <p>I love bringing human connection and breathing life into the backlit screens we stare at every day.</p>
            

            <p>I’m a feeler. I’m a visual-thinker.</p>
            <p>I dive head-first.</p>
            <p>Craftsmanship is a key element in my work and I am a firm believer that if you approach every situation with empathy and compassion, the rest will naturally fall into place.</p>
            
            </div>

            <p>My background in ballet, hip-hop and contemporary dance coupled with my passion for fine art and film photography inform the way I approach UX design. Dance gave me the skills to know how to work with people as a unit, how space and sequence translates into emotional response, and gave me an outlet to constantly explore new creative patterns. </p>

            <p>Photography let me put my thoughts onto paper. Well, really onto film. Knowledge of photographic compostion gives me the ability to understand how to organize visual information on a sheet of film, page, or screen. I spent most of my photographic career reaching out to LGBTQ communities across the pacific northwest. I was able to connect with them and understand what elements -both physical and otherwise- were important to them and capture their image in a gratifying way. I graduated with a degree in Fine Art Photography from Western Washington University in 2014.
